### A C# ASP.NET MVC webapp

This site has been built by following along with the course [Becoming a Full-Stack .NET Developer](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/full-stack-dot-net-developer-fundamentals) from [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/).
To add my own flair, Twitter Bootstrap 4 is the styling framework of choice, over the course's older Bootstrap 3.
